# Daily-Planner

## Description

- This project was built to further my understanding and apply what I learned about third party APIs. In an effort to apply the concepts I learned in our course using Jquery, bootstrap, and Dayjs. When writing out the code for this project I challenged myself to make a better effort to stick to the concept of DRY and not repeat myself and make it more of a challenge overall. I found myself learning more about how to properly used the Jquery selectors and how to better use and access the local storage on the browser.
